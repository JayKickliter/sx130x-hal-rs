@brief Schedule a packet to be send immediately or after a delay depending on tx_mode
@param pkt_data structure containing the data and metadata for the packet to send
@return LGW_HAL_ERROR id the operation failed, LGW_HAL_SUCCESS else

/!\ When sending a packet, there is a delay (approx 1.5ms) for the analog
circuitry to start and be stable. This delay is adjusted by the HAL depending
on the board version (lgw_i_tx_start_delay_us).

In 'timestamp' mode, this is transparent: the modem is started
lgw_i_tx_start_delay_us microseconds before the user-set timestamp value is
reached, the preamble of the packet start right when the internal timestamp
counter reach target value.

In 'immediate' mode, the packet is emitted as soon as possible: transferring the
packet (and its parameters) from the host to the concentrator takes some time,
then there is the lgw_i_tx_start_delay_us, then the packet is emitted.

In 'triggered' mode (aka PPS/GPS mode), the packet, typically a beacon, is
emitted lgw_i_tx_start_delay_us microsenconds after a rising edge of the
trigger signal. Because there is no way to anticipate the triggering event and
start the analog circuitry beforehand, that delay must be taken into account in
the protocol.
